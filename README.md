# API Gateway

The API Gateway is a central entry point for managing and routing requests to various microservices in a distributed system. It serves as a single entry point for clients to interact with your microservices architecture.

## Features

- **Routing:** Direct incoming requests to the appropriate microservice based on the request path or other criteria.
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of a microservice for improved performance and reliability.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce security policies by authenticating and authorizing incoming requests before they reach the microservices.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Capture and analyze request/response data for monitoring, logging, and analytics purposes.
- **Rate Limiting:** Control the rate at which clients can make requests to prevent abuse or ensure fair usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Maven build tool
- Configuration for microservices to route requests

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ngolik/api-gateway.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd api-gateway
    ```

3. Build the project:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

4. Run the API Gateway:

    ```bash
    java -jar target/api-gateway-2022.0.4.jar
    ```

   Replace `<version>` with the actual version number.

5. Access the API Gateway:

   Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Configuration

Customize the API Gateway configuration by modifying the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. Configure routes, load balancing, security policies, and other settings according to your requirements.

## Usage

1. **Define Routes:**
   Configure routes in the API Gateway to map incoming requests to the appropriate microservices.

2. **Load Balancing:**
   Configure load balancing settings to distribute traffic across multiple instances of microservices for scalability and fault tolerance.

3. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   Implement authentication and authorization filters to secure your microservices.

4. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   Set up logging and monitoring to capture and analyze request/response data for insights and troubleshooting.
